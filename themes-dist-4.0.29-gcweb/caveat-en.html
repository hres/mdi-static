                        <p>This information relates to information taken from medical device problem reports that are
                            submitted to Health Canada by health professionals and consumers, either directly to Health
                            Canada or via market authorization holders (manufacturers and importers). Each report
                            represents the suspicion, opinion, or observation of the individual making the report. Also
                            included in this extract is information about recall reports, submitted by manufacturers and
                            importers. Health Canada’s post market surveillance of medical devices includes the Canada
                            Vigilance - Medical Device Problem Reporting Program and medical devices compliance and
                            enforcement staff within Health Canada’s Regulatory Operations and Regions Branch, and is
                            designed to detect signals of potential health product safety issues during the post-market
                            period. The data is collected primarily by a spontaneous surveillance system in which device
                            problems and adverse events are reported on a voluntary basis. However, Health Canada is
                            aware that medical device incidents are often underreported to both voluntary and mandatory
                            spontaneous surveillance systems.</p>

                        <p>The number of incidents in the Medical Devices System incident and recall data extract is not
                            suitable for inferring the incidence or prevalence of a problem or for estimating risk
                            associated with a particular medical device, as neither the total number of problems
                            occurring, nor the number of patients exposed to the medical device, is known. Because of
                            the multiple factors that influence reporting, quantitative comparisons of medical device
                            safety should not be made from the data. Some of these factors include the length of time a
                            device is marketed, the market share, publicity about problems with a device or class of
                            devices, and regulatory actions. In some cases, the reported clinical data is incomplete and
                            there is uncertainty that the device(s) caused the reported health effects. A given health
                            effect may be due to an underlying disease process or to another coincidental factor.</p>

                <ol class="lst-spcd">
                    <li>Incident data has been collected primarily by a spontaneous surveillance system in which
                        incidents involving medical devices are reported to industry (manufacturers and importers) and
                        Health Canada on a voluntary basis.
                    </li>
                    <li>Recall data has been collected from industry (manufacturers and importers) who are required
                        to report recalls to Health Canada once a recall has been initiated, as well as recalls that
                        have been ordered by Health Canada.

                    <li>There is underreporting of incidents with both voluntary and mandatory surveillance systems.

                    <li>Medical device problem reports are suspected associations which reflect the opinion or
                        observation of the individual reporter. The data presented reflects, as much as possible, the
                        reporter's observations and opinions, and does not reflect any Health Canada assessment of
                        association between the device and the patient health effects or outcomes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Medical device recalls data presented reflects, as much as possible, the submitter’s
                        information, and does not reflect any Health Canada Assessment of association between the device
                        and the patient health effects or outcomes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inclusion of a particular health effect in an incident does not necessarily mean that it was
                        caused by the medical device(s). The purpose of medical devices post market surveillance within
                        the Canada Vigilance Program and the Regulatory Operations and Regions Branch is to detect
                        possible signals of adverse events or problems associated with medical devices. Additional
                        scientific investigations are required to validate signals from these areas and to establish a
                        cause and effect relationship between a device and a reported health effect. Assessment of
                        causality must include other factors such as temporal associations, the possible contribution of
                        concomitant medication or therapies, the underlying disease, and the previous medical history.
                    </li>
                    <li>The number of incidents should not be used as a basis for determining the incidence of a
                        problem or health effect as neither the total number of incidents occurring, nor the number of
                        people exposed to the device is known
                    </li>
                    <li>Numerical comparisons should not be made between problems associated with different devices on
                        the basis of the data.
                    </li>
                    <li>Where an incident may involve multiple devices, it may not be possible to determine which, if
                        any, of the devices involved in the incident were responsible for a particular health effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>In order to be entered into the database, information from mandatory problem reports are
                        coded using adverse event terminology terms and codes (device problems and health effects) which
                        represent the incident described in the report. The coding of reports is subject to limitations
                        of coding terminology.
                    </li>
                    <li>The data provided do not represent all known safety information concerning the device(s) and
                        should not be used in isolation to make decisions regarding the use of these devices; other
                        sources of information should be consulted.
                    </li>
                    <li>The assistance of a health care professional should be sought to aid in the interpretation
                        of the information contained herein.
                    </li>
                    <li>1The database is routinely checked for duplicate reports. Duplicate reports are reports
                        related to the same incident received from more than one source (e.g., industry and consumer).
                        It is not always possible to detect duplicate reports, often because the documentation in the
                        original report may be variable or incomplete. When duplicates are detected, the incidents are
                        merged in the system.
                    </li>
                    <li>Recalls listed by Health Canada may not be found in the databases of other jurisdictions,
                        and vice versa, due to differing regulatory reporting requirements and differing definitions of
                        what constitutes a recall.
                    </li>
